# Longitudinal-Flight-Simulator
Flight simulator in Python for comparing longitudinal flight dynamics of two aircraft (north American L-17 Navion and Boeing 747)

## Features
- Linearized state-space models for both aircraft
- Numerical simulation of response to elevator inputs
- Visualization of speed, angle of attack, pitch rate, pitch angle, and control input
- Educational tool to compare the dynamic behavior of a small GA aircraft vs. a wide-body airliner

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## How to Use
Run the script and input:
- Duration of simulation
- Number and timing of elevator inputs

## Disclaimer
This is a personal educational project and **not validated** for engineering use.
